      </p>
      <p>
        Need a professional website made with quick turnaround for your business, company, or idea that hasn't launched yet?
      </p>
      <p>
        All of my websites are built from scratch using the web development framework known as Ruby on Rails. So whether it's a simple, static landing page for your art or music, or something more complex (e.g. custom social networks or inventory management systems), you've come to the right place.
      </p>
      <p>
        My specialties include website design, hosting, mobile responsive websites, search engine optimization, and full scale content management systems.

The web design he did for my website is much like the professional musician’s websites that I’ve seen and I’m lucky to have come across someone who cares about their customers as much as he does!<i class="double_quote">"</i>
